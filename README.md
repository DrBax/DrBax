# DrBax
Dr Narissa Bax is an early career marine scientist based in the Australian National Fish Collection (ANFC) at CSIRO. She has collaborated with CSIRO since 2011 when the National Environmental Science Program (NESP) Marine Biodiversity Hub sponsored a research placement at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum as part of her PhD. This experience introduced her to taxonomy and the skills associated with species description and publication, such as Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, specimen photography, biogeography and the opportunities available to biodiversity science in museum collections. She subsequently visited collections all over the world and began working at CSIRO in 2017, first as a visiting scientist to collaborate on biological material from the Great Australian Bight and with the ANFC in 2018. She continues to collaborate with the Australian Antarctic Division and the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, advocating for the importance of specimen based biological research. Narissa Bax has participated in multiple benthic marine surveys in Antarctica over the last ~10 years and hopes to extend on her at sea experience during her career at CSIRO.
